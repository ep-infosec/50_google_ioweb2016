            <li><b>Sign in</b>: By signing into the site, you can create a customized I/O schedule. </li>
            <li><b>Push notifications</b>: You can choose to receive notifications when I/O is about to start, events added to My Schedule are about to start, and videos of sessions added to My Schedule are available. Note: Notifications are only supported in Chrome, on Android and desktop, and activated per device.

          <ul>
          <li><b>Badge pick-up</b>: Everyone is guaranteed a seat for the keynote but the best seats will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. Badge pick-up starts at 7:00AM on May 17 so make sure to come by early!</li>
          <li><b>Meals</b>: Attendees are offered complimentary breakfast, lunch and snacks on all days of the conference.</li>

          </ul>

          <h5 id="badges">Badges &amp; badge pick-up</h5>
          <p>To expedite the check-in process, we will begin badge pick-up on Tuesday, May 17, at Shoreline Amphitheatre. Make sure to bring your photo ID along with your registration confirmation email, as we&#8217;ll need to verify it prior to assigning you your Google I/O badge. We&#8217;re OK with government issued licenses, passports, and other forms of identification. If you don&#8217;t have proper identification, you won&#8217;t be able to receive a badge and won&#8217;t be admitted into the conference. If you&#8217;re an Academic attendee, please remember to bring proof of eligibility.</p>
          <p><b>New this year</b>: Everyone is guaranteed a seat for the keynote but the best seats will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis during badge pick-up beginning at 7am on May 17. So make sure to come by early!</p>
          <p>Please note, you may not share, give, or otherwise provide your badge to anyone. Google I/O badges aren&#8217;t replaceable, so don&#8217;t lose yours or you won&#8217;t be readmitted to the conference. You must wear your Google I/O badge to gain admission to Google I/O and to visit the sessions, developer sandbox, and After Hours parties. If requested by security, please display or provide additional identification. Google I/O badges may include your name, company or organization (if provided), and photo.</p>

          <!-- <h5 id="giveaways">Giveaways</h5>
          <p>Any devices received at I/O are intended for development use. If you receive a device made available to I/O attendees, you must pick it up in person and you are responsible for the device once you have picked it up. Device choices at I/O are final and you may not exchange for another option at a later date. Devices received at I/O may not be certified for use outside the U.S., may not be cleared to be exported from the U.S., and may create an obligation to pay duties or taxes, for which you are solely responsible. For warranty purposes, devices received at I/O are treated as if they had been purchased in the U.S. Some devices may not come with a warranty. Please refer to the device documentation for more info.</p> -->

          <h5 id="afterhours">After Hours</h5>
          <p>All registered attendees are invited to the After Hours parties on the evenings of May 18th and May 19th. Festival credentials will be required for entry. Please join us for food, drinks, music, games, and more. Alcoholic beverages will be available for those 21 and over.</p>

          <h5 id="attire">Event attire</h5>
          <p>Google I/O is a developer event, so please be comfortable and casual. There is no enforced dress code. Please note, the entire festival will be outdoors this year. The Bay Area gets chilly in the evenings, so take this into consideration when planning your attire.</p>

          <h5 id="a11y">Accessibility accommodations for attendees</h5>
          <p>Google strives to make events open and accessible to everyone, regardless of disability or special needs. For event participants with disabilities and/or special needs, please let us know during registration or send an email to <a href="mailto:io16@google.com" target="_blank">io16@google.com</a>. This information will be kept private and will be distributed only to the individuals who need to know it to complete your accommodation request.</p>
          <p>Shoreline Amphitheatre is an entirely outdoor venue. While the keynote will be taking place in an open-air amphitheatre, the sessions will take place in enclosed areas. All areas of the venue are accessible for wheelchair users. Additionally, there will be a service dog relief area.</p>
          <p>We will provide live real-time transcription (CART) for the keynote and some of our sessions. Caption text displayed on a large screen at the front of the room will be accessible to all attendees. We will also use the text to provide captions for I/O Live and post-event recordings.</p>
          <p>We will be happy to provide an ASL interpreter to accompany you in the sessions at Google I/O. We will do our best to find a technical translator that is familiar with the domain, but please keep in mind that the interpreter will probably not be able to meet with the speakers beforehand. Please let us know during registration if you need an ASL interpreter at Google I/O.</p>
          <p>ADA parking spaces will be available in Lot D. When arriving to the venue, please follow signs for ADA parking and have your placard hanging from the car mirror and visible to parking employees at all times to expedite the parking process. Accessible parking spaces are readily available on a first-come, first-served basis and may not be reserved in advance to fairly serve all attendees.</p>
          <p>If you have other specific needs, please let us know during your registration or send an email to <a href="mailto:io16@google.com" target="_blank">io16@google.com</a>. Otherwise, please approach the Help Desk at Google I/O if you need assistance or have questions about accessibility.</p>

          <h5 id="conduct">Google Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy</h5>
          <p>Google is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Google takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately. For more information on Google’s Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy, please see <a href="https://www.google.com/events/policy/anti-harassmentpolicy.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>All participants of Google events must abide by the following policy:</p>

          <h6>Be excellent to each other.</h6>
          <p>Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. Jokes shouldn’t demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to or about you.</p>

          <h6>Speak up if you see or hear something.</h6>
          <p>Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.</p>

          <h6>Practice saying &#8220;Yes and&#8221; to each other.</h6>
          <p>It’s a theatre improv technique to build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</p>

          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
